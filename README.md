# Jarvis Project: Lifelong Learning AI with Constant RAG Systems

## Project Progress

`[█████—————————–] 7% Complete`

## Project Overview

The **Jarvis Project** aims to create a personalized, constantly learning AI agent using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The project seeks to enhance the current limitations of large language models (LLMs) by enabling real-time learning and retrieval of information through vector databases.

## Notes

- **Vector Database**: The vector database may contain personal information about Barathan, so it is advised to start with a clean database to ensure privacy and maintain data consistency.

- **Development**: This project was developed using a combination of AI models and tools, including **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, and **Claude**.

- **Qdrant Setup**: Qdrant can be easily set up using Docker. If you have the `docker-compose.yml` file provided in this project, you can directly start the Qdrant service by running the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
